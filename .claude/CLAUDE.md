# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with the glabmetrics project.

## Project Overview

**glabmetrics** is a powerful Python-based GitLab statistics analyzer with enhanced KPI analysis (P1-P6) that helps DevOps teams and platform engineers understand their GitLab instance, identify critical issues, and implement actionable optimization recommendations through comprehensive HTML reports.

## Build and Test Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
pdm install

# Run all tests (77 tests total)
pdm run test

# Run tests with coverage
pdm run test-cov

# Run linting (flake8)
pdm run lint

# Run security scan (bandit)
pdm run security

# Build the project
pdm build

# Run the CLI tool
python -m glabmetrics --help

# Enhanced KPI Analysis (Default behavior!) - use PDM
pdm run glabmetrics https://gitlab.example.com token --verbose
pdm run analyze https://gitlab.example.com token --verbose

# Basic analysis mode (disable Enhanced KPIs)
pdm run glabmetrics https://gitlab.example.com token --basic
```

## Architecture Overview

This is a modern Python application following a clean architecture pattern:

### Core Components
- **`main.py`** - CLI entry point with Click framework and enhanced KPI integration
- **`gitlab_client.py`** - GitLab API client with comprehensive error handling and rate limiting
- **`analyzer.py`** - Core analysis engine with scoring algorithms
- **`enhanced_report_generator.py`** - Modern Bootstrap 5 HTML reports with tab-based dashboard
- **`parallel_collector.py`** - Multi-threaded data collection with CPU count workers by default
- **`data_storage.py`** - JSON-based data persistence with enhanced analysis caching
- **`performance_tracker.py`** - Performance monitoring with KPI analysis tracking

### Enhanced KPI Analyzers (NEW!)
- **`enhanced_issue_analyzer.py`** - P1: Issue backlog health and workflow analysis
- **`enhanced_mr_analyzer.py`** - P2: Code review quality and MR lead time analysis
- **`enhanced_ci_analyzer.py`** - P3: CI/CD insights and runner usage analysis
- **`enhanced_ci_config_analyzer.py`** - P4: GitLab-CI configuration best practices
- **`enhanced_submodule_analyzer.py`** - P5: Submodule network graphs and dependency analysis
- **`enhanced_performance_analyzer.py`** - P6: Performance guidelines and caching recommendations

### Key Features
- **üéØ Enhanced KPI Analysis** - P1-P6 deep analysis with parallel processing (6x speedup)
- **üìã Critical Issues Detection** - Binary performance killers, repository sprawl, CI/CD gaps
- **üöÄ Actionable Recommendations** - Concrete bash commands with expected results
- **‚ö° Parallel Collection** - Multi-threaded data gathering with intelligent caching
- **üìä Tab-Based Dashboard** - Modern Bootstrap 5 HTML reports with responsive design
- **üîÑ Smart Incremental Updates** - Default behavior with intelligent cache management
- **üìÅ Auto-Generated Paths** - Automatic file paths to `.generated/` directory
- **GitLab API Integration** - Full support for GitLab 17.x+ with fallback compatibility
- **Advanced Scoring** - Repository complexity, health, and hotness scores
- **Storage Analysis** - Comprehensive breakdown of storage usage (LFS, artifacts, packages)
- **Security-First** - XSS protection with Jinja2 autoescape enabled
- **Modern Python** - Type hints, dataclasses, comprehensive error handling

### Code Standards & Formatting
- **Line Length**: 88 characters (Black standard, configured in `.flake8` and `pyproject.toml`)
- **Code Style**: Black formatting with PSF community standards
- **Formatting Command**: `pdm run format` (auto-formats all Python files)
- **Linting**: flake8 with community-ready configuration
- **Testing**: pytest with 77 comprehensive tests
- **Dependencies**: Managed with PDM

### Code Generation Guidelines
When generating new code, follow these standards:
- Use 88-character line limit (Black standard)
- Apply type hints consistently (`from typing import Dict, List, Optional`)
- Use dataclasses for structured data (`@dataclass`)
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase (see existing analyzers)
- Add comprehensive error handling with try/except blocks
- Use descriptive variable names and docstrings
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- **Post-Generation**: Always run `pdm run format` to ensure perfect formatting

### Data Flow
1. **Collection** - ParallelGitLabCollector fetches data with multi-threading (CPU count workers by default)
2. **Basic Analysis** - GitLabAnalyzer processes and scores repositories
3. **Enhanced Analysis** - P1-P6 KPI analyzers run in parallel (6x speedup)
4. **Storage** - GitLabDataStorage handles caching with enhanced analysis persistence
5. **Issue Detection** - Critical issues analysis with binary performance killers detection
6. **Recommendations** - Actionable best practices with concrete implementation steps
7. **Reporting** - EnhancedHTMLReportGenerator creates tab-based Bootstrap 5 dashboards

### Security Considerations
- **XSS Protection** - All user content properly escaped in HTML templates
- **Input Validation** - Comprehensive validation of API responses
- **No Secrets Logging** - Sensitive data (tokens, URLs) never logged
- **Safe JSON Handling** - Proper escaping in JavaScript contexts

### Testing Strategy
- **77 Tests Total** - Comprehensive coverage across all components
- **Security Tests** - XSS protection and data validation (7 tests)
- **Template Tests** - HTML generation and data preparation (6 tests)
- **Integration Tests** - End-to-end workflow testing
- **Mock-Heavy** - Isolated unit tests with extensive mocking

### Recent Major Features (v2.0)
- **üéØ Enhanced KPI Analysis** - P1-P6 analyzers enabled by default with parallel processing
- **üìã Critical Issues Detection** - Binary performance killers, storage waste detection
- **üöÄ Actionable Recommendations** - Concrete bash commands with expected results
- **‚ö° Simplified CLI Interface** - Streamlined options with intelligent defaults
- **üìä Tab-Based Dashboard** - Modern Bootstrap 5 HTML with responsive design

- **üìÅ Auto-Generated Paths** - Automatic output paths to `.generated/` directory
- **üìà Performance Tracking** - Separate JSON files with detailed performance statistics

### Development Workflow
1. **Initial Setup**: `pdm run setup-dev` - One-time developer environment setup
   - Cleans workspace (removes target/, .generated/, caches)
   - Creates target/ directory for build outputs
   - Installs pre-commit hooks for automatic code quality checks
2. **Development Cycle**:
   - Make code changes following existing patterns
   - `pdm run check-fast` - Quick validation during development (format-check + lint + test-fast)
   - `pdm run check` - Full CI-like validation before commits (format-check + lint + typecheck + security + test-cov)
3. **Code Standards**:
   - Use existing dataclasses (`RepositoryStats`, `SystemStats`)
   - Follow type hint conventions throughout
   - Add tests for all new functionality
   - Use descriptive commit messages with `pdm run commit` (conventional commits)

### Code Quality Standards (Single Source of Truth)
- **Line Length**: 88 characters (Black/PSF standard)
- **Configuration**: All tools read from `pyproject.toml` - change line-length in ONE place
- **Tools**: Black (formatting), isort (imports), flake8 (linting), mypy (typing), bandit (security)
- **Pre-commit**: Automatic quality checks on every commit using PDM-managed tools
