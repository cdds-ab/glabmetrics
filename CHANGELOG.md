## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.0] - 2025-01-27

### üéØ Major Features Added
- **Enhanced KPI Analysis (P1-P6)**: Deep GitLab analytics with 6 specialized analyzers
  - P1: Issue KPI Analysis - Backlog health, resolution times, workflow efficiency
  - P2: Code Review Quality - MR lead times, approval bottlenecks, review patterns
  - P3: CI/CD Insights - Runner usage, pipeline success rates, Jenkins webhooks
  - P4: Configuration Check - GitLab-CI best practices, security, caching
  - P5: Network Analysis - Submodule dependency graphs, circular dependencies
  - P6: Performance Guidelines - Caching recommendations, large file optimization

### üìã Critical Issues Detection
- **Binary Performance Killers**: Automatic detection of repositories with >500 binary files
- **Repository Sprawl Analysis**: Identification of inactive/obsolete repositories wasting resources
- **CI/CD Coverage Gaps**: Detection of active development without automation

### ‚ö° Performance Improvements
- **Parallel KPI Collection**: All P1-P6 analyses run simultaneously (6x speedup)
- **Multi-threaded Data Gathering**: Up to 20 parallel workers for repository collection
- **Incremental Updates**: `--incremental` flag for changed-repositories-only updates
- **Speed Modes**: Ultra-fast (10x), Balanced (5x), Fast (3x) collection options
- **Enhanced Caching**: JSON-based persistence with enhanced analysis data storage

### üìä Modern Dashboard
- **Tab-Based Interface**: Switchable Overview, Repository Details, Storage, Recommendations
- **Bootstrap 5.3**: Responsive design with FontAwesome icons and Chart.js integration
